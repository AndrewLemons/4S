# 4S
Simple School Security System

# About
4S is made to be a simple but effective method of protecting students in K-12 schools. While other systems that propose the same goal do exist, the aspect of being open-source and fully customizable is the most promonent feature.

4S is modern, secure, and easy to use when emergency situations arrise.

# Development Progress
The system is not safe to use in a actualy school... yet.
